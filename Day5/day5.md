# Day 5

## Topics covered:
Kadane's Algorithm
`Uses`: implement the maximum subarray sum problem, with O(n). 

## Problems solved:
1. Maximum sub array sum - Code Studio 
`Intuition`: Whenever `sum`<0, update sum = 0. Whenever sum > max, update max = sum.

2. Flip Bits - Code Studio
`Intuition`: Represent every 1 as `-1` and every 0 as `+1`.
